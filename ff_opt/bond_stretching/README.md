# Opt Bond Stretching
Optimization of the bond-stretching term via biaxial strain deformation experiments

# Description
This folder contains the source code for the biaxial strain deformation experiments

# Organization
The folder includes the following files and directories:
 - README.md -> current file
 - BNstr_4.7519.in -> Example Quantum Espresso input file for hBN with lattice constant 4.7519 Bohr..
 - BNstr_4.7519.out -> Example Quantum Espresso output file for hBN with lattice constant 4.7519 Bohr..
 - BN_stretch_script -> Bash script for scheduling multiple simulations
 - bond_stretching.xlsx -> Excel file demonstrating the fitting of data to the Morse force-field.
