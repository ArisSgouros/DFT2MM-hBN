# Opt bond-angle bending
Optimization of the bond-angle-bending term. by applying biaxial strain.

# Description
This folder contains source code for deformation experiments that modify in-plane angles while preserving bond length

# Organization
The folder includes the following files and directories:
 - README.md -> current file
 - hBN_abend.in -> Quantum Espresso input file.
 - hBN_abend.out -> Quantum Espresso output file.
 - bond_angle_bending.xlsx -> Excel file demonstrating the fitting of data to the multi-harmonic potential.
